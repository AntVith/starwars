#Star Wars

This application shows planets from Star Wars.
Once the user clicks a specific planet they can view the planet info and residents that live there.

## To view this application use this link:   https://starwars-ivory.vercel.app/

For this project I utilized React for the frontend.

## If you were to run the project locally:

After cloning ->  cd into the project root directory -> run "npm start" in the terminal
